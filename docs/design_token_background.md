previously in our intro to Design Systems course we followed Kai a product designer at the habit forming app called habits on their journey to building their first design system in figma since implementing their design system the habits team has seen more consistency in designs and no longer debates endlessly over which standards to use however the habits app is evolving and growing after discovering that their users track their habits before bed the team wants to add a dark theme to ease tired eyes while

the spatial system has sped up the design process and solved alignment issues the team struggles to keep track of which border radius and spacing values to use this has led to an unpredictable and inconsistent user experience and they're adding new teammates and features and want a more efficient way to manage changes and improve accuracy during the handoff process Kai has been learning about design tokens and believes that this could be the next step in supporting scalability of the habits design

system the benefits of design tokens are very similar to that of Design Systems they're a source of truth that maintains consistency between design and code they improve management of a scaling design system and they remove the guesswork when building products and help you build more efficiently but what exactly are design tokens how might this help the habits team design tokens are a method for managing design properties and values across a design system each token stores a piece of information such

as color sizing spacing font animations and so on to make them easier to refer to each token also gets a name the tokens can be reused across your designs and become a source of Truth and shared language between design and code for example Kai recently handed a design file to a developer that contains spacing values of 25 points however the habits codebase uses an 8o spatial system the developer assumed this was intentional and updated the codebase with the new designs oops Kai actually meant to have spacing values of 24

points but their file was set up incorrectly if the team used Tokens The Design file would have included information on which spacing token to use the spacing token would point to a value that's already confirmed to be correct preventing errors and ambiguity in addition to having a reliable source of Truth using tokens means that updating our designs and design system becomes faster and more efficient for example say the habits team has this color token being used in different areas of the product if they

change the value of this color token then every asset using the token will change too this can be useful like when changing a color system for a product Rebrand however what if they only wanted the values of some assets to change currently they'd have to remap these values one by one to a different token this isn't a problem if only a few assets need updating but if many assets had to be updated the habits team would need a lot more time and resources this is where aliasing comes in aliasing

allows any token to reference or take on the value of another token if a token changes then any token referencing it will update as well but how does this solve the habits team problem well aliasing lets you neatly organize tokens into categories subcategories and so on the categories communicate how a token is used if habits had their tokens set up correctly they'd be able to quickly update any category and all Associated tokens Downstream would get updated without unintentionally affecting others

there's no limit to how far a series of token references can go and no limit to how many times a single token can be referenced allowing us to create complex design token structures keep in mind aliasing isn't always necessary especially for assets like fonts and animations after realizing the benefits the habits team decided to implement design tokens in their system before they jump in they they want to understand how tokens are organized the most common structure of design tokens starts with the foundation of values

called primitive tokens from there you can build on top of your foundation with semantic tokens and component specific tokens each type communicates a what how and where about the token let's take a closer look at each one starting with our foundation primitive tokens tell us what properties and values exist within our designs also known as Global tokens they Define every value in a property system for example primitive color tokens would include every color used in the app and its brand while primitive spacing tokens

would include all padding margin and spacing between values note that primitive tokens are reference only they are the foundation for other tokens to build from but are never applied directly in [Music] designs semantic tokens however can can be applied to designs semantic tokens gives us context on the how the token should be used as noted in lesson two assets with semantic names convey meaning purpose and how and where the asset should be used for example the token surfaced brand contrast references A Primitive token

called pink 400 it takes on whatever value pink 400 is set to surface tells us that it should be used for an object's background color bran tells us that the color is Central to the app's identity and contrast tells us that this color is saturated and should be used to grab a user's attention lastly we have component specific tokens which provide us even more specificity on usage by telling us where a token is used and Yep they're used directly in designs too say we have a set of buttons primary and secondary

each with a state default hover and inactive we could create a token for each one button primary for example could reference surface brand contrast since primary buttons should grab a user's attention the token for this could look something like button primary background default the rest of the buttons tokens would follow the same format asset type property State this level of tokens is detailed and more commonly used by larger Enterprise level systems so component specific tokens might not be necessary for

everyone design token structures should always begin with the foundation of primitive tokens beyond that is entirely up to the unique needs of your system and organization you might only need semantic tokens or component specific tokens added on you might need both in any order that you need they could be on the same level you might even want to have multiple levels of each type whatever the format take the time to to thoughtfully plan what your token structure will look like this will save hassle in the long run as any future

restructures could require significant time and effort now that we've gotten a better grasp on design tokens let's check back in with the habits team they decided to set up both semantic and component specific tokens on the same level since their design system already lives in figma they can use two key figma features to implement their tokens Styles and variables before we continue check out our resources on Styles and variables to get an understanding of how they work you might be wondering why

should the habits team use both Styles and variables variables can support complex token structures because they can be used to define other variables and styles they can also support multiple modes for theming scoping for specifically where a variable can be used en code syntax for a better handoff experience meanwhile styles can support color gradients and composite values like multiple fills or multiple shadow effects for many implementing design tokens means a combination of styles and variables to get more insight on the

difference between Styles and variables check out the article linked below Kai is interested in diving into migrating colors first if you followed along in lesson three you'll know that the habits app color system is connected to color styles each organized by their purpose or usage the habits team decided to migrate all of their color styles to variables except for one gradient which will keep us a style since variables can't capture gradients they create a new variables collection called

Primitives for their primitive tokens and copy each color value over each color variable is organized by their base color within each base color a ramp is created based on their tint and shape using a numbering system the more white a base color contains the lower its number the more black it contains the higher the number tip to prevent primitive tokens from being used directly in designs you can scope and hide them from getting published to team libraries from The Primitives collection select all the

variables rightclick and choose edit variables from the edit modal uncheck the show in all supported properties box and and check the hide from publishing box next they want to direct how and where the colors can be used so they create a second variables collection called tokens for their semantic and component specific tokens the team conducted an audit to document every color used in the product and identified a few areas that use color surface button text border and icon within each area they further

identified color categories like brand toast user colors and more from there they establish tokens within each category and gave them names that communicate how or where the color can be used for example a semantic token might include the word primary to communicate its use on the most common elements or actions on a page secondary on the other hand are for Less common elements after creating these tokens they Oran organiz them into variable groups based on their categories and apply them to their

designs now that our color Primitives and semantic tokens are set up how might they approach dark mode remember that every semantic and component specific token is assigned a job and communicates a function to add a dark mode or any other theme you need to create a separate set of tokens that mirrors the existing tokens within this set they can change any aliases or references as needed by connecting them to different tokens in figma design the habits team is able to account for a dark mode theme through variable modes

they create a new mode in the tokens collection and update references to variables in The Primitives collection as needed and that's it no need to change the names of tokens since they already communicate information on how and where they're used changing a design to dark mode can be quickly done from the right side bar the habits team is all done setting up their color tokens so they tackle their spatial system using number variables next we cover creating number variables for spatial systems more in

our intro to variables tutorial so be sure to check it out tips for naming tokens if you're ready to set up tokens for your design system here's a few tips to help you with naming make sure tokens are easy to understand creating language neutral names makes them approachable across different teams you may want to factor in people from different countries as well use full words instead of abbreviation abbreviations can be unclear and open to interpretation be consistent with prefixes for example token names for

background color should start with background instead of appearing in a different part of the name use single or plural names based on their context for which they're being used if you have multiple products or Brands avoid using the Brand's name in a token instead choose a more generic name so that tokens can be used in broader context future proof tokens by anticipating potential growth of your design system token name should be able to accommodate new additions and modifications without

causing confusion now that the tokens are set up to go Kai and the habits team are looking forward to building dark mode for their users and experiencing the efficiency that this shared language provides are you ready to dive even deeper into design tokens and variables check out our resources below or let us know what you want to learn about next and be sure to like And subscribe to keep up to date with the latest product and Community News we'll see you in the next [Music] one
